    <h1>IO Team Projects</h1>
    <p>My name is Guillermo Rauch and I'm the co-founder and CTO of 
    <a href="https://learnboost.com" target="_blank">LearnBoost</a>
    and <a href="https://cloudup.com" target="_blank">Cloudup</a> (acquired by Wordpress.com),
    and creator of several open-source libraries like
    <a href="http://socket.io" target="_blank">socket.io</a> and
    <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a>.</p>

    <p>I was involved with Node.JS and server-side JavaScript from the 
    beginnings and have assisted or contributed to the creation of many
    projects in the ecosystem. I'm the author of the book
    <a href="http://bit.ly/smashingnode" target="_blank">Smashing Node.JS</a> published by Wiley.</p>

    <h2>Focus</h2>
    <p>The main focus of the mentorship will be on exploring technologies
    related to the realtime web and Node.JS.</p>
    <p>Learning how to properly design APIs and the best-practices 
    related to testing and writing code, as well as contributing to the
    open-source ecosystem will be goals of the mentorship.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Socket.IO</h3>
    <p>Some students will work on the core socket.io code, contributing
    patches, documentation, API improvements, and plugins.</p>
    <p>We're interested in exploring performance improvements, like 
    sharing a single connection over many open tabs of a web application
    in a browser seamlessly to avoid extra TCP connections.</p>

    <h3>Engine.IO</h3>
    <p>Engine.IO is a WebSocket-compatible API that works on all browsers,
    from IE6 to the latest Chrome.</p>
    <p>It enables the creation of higher-level frameworks like socket.io.</p>
    <p>Improving mobile support and performance for engine.io libraries
    is one of the most important outstanding challenges.</p>

    <h3>MyDB.IO</h3>

    <p>Today a single data source can be accessed and modified through
    a variety of different devices, browser and applications
    simultaneously.</p>
    <p>However, the APIs for displaying data changes in realtime and 
    conveying them are largely missing.</p>
    <p>MyDB is the framework used to build Cloudup's realtime data sync
    capabilities. You can find out more about the project
    <a href="https://cloudup.com/blog/introducing-mydb" target="_blank">here</a> which
    will be open-sourced in the coming days.</p>
    <p>Students will be able to work on a lot of new exciting challenges
    associated with scalability, security and more.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>Familiarity with the following concepts will be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Git, Github.</li>
      <li>JavaScript, JSON, Node.JS.</li>
      <li>HTML, CSS</li>
